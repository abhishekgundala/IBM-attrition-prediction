Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict employee attrition at IBM using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key factors influencing turnover, the model helps organizations develop targeted retention strategies to reduce costs and retain valuable talent.

#**Project Overview**

**Objective**: Identify the primary reasons for employee attrition and predict potential future turnover using machine learning models.
Data Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset.
Key Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature selection, logistic regression, decision trees, and cross-validation.
Key Features

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigates relationships between employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and attrition rates.
Feature Engineering: Optimized selection of relevant features like monthly income, overtime, business travel, and years since last promotion.
Predictive Modeling: Utilized logistic regression and decision tree models with cross-validation to identify high-risk employees.
Model Performance: Evaluated model accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrices to ensure robust predictions.
Insights & Outcomes

**High-Risk Factors**: Business travel, overtime, and job involvement emerged as significant predictors of attrition.
Department-Specific Analysis: Separate models built for Sales, HR, and R&D departments to tailor retention strategies.
Actionable Recommendations: Suggestions to improve work-life balance, compensation structures, and professional development opportunities to reduce turnover.
